## Overview
Parkedex provides information on the 63 National Parks across the United States.

In addition it allows a user to track what parks they have visited and created basic visit logs for indiviudal visits to a park.

All park data was gathered using Python scripts to scrap data from the National Park Service API.
Google Maps API used to provide map data for individual parks when on each park page.

## Future Features
 * Campground data for each park (marker on google maps, open and closed info)
 * Campgrounds added to visit logs
 * Get alerts from individual parks.
